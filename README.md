 **_Model-Driven App_** :computer:

 In this academic project, the goal was to develop a Model-Driven App from scratch. This involved the creation of all the necessary Dataverse tables, form desing, establishment of the tables relationship, implementation of business rules, integration of cloud flows, developed initially on Power Automate. Each step was crucial in crafting a comprehensive and functional solution tailored to the specific needs of the project.

**_Power Automate_** :computer:

When engaging with the core components of the Power Platform, prioritizing process automation became essential to streamline user interactions. This approach aimed to enhance user experience by automating repetitive tasks and simplifying complex processes, ultimately fostering seamless interaction and efficiency within the platform.

1 - The goal of developing this Power Automate was to trigger an approval process when an item and its corresponding price were added to the Dataverse table.
