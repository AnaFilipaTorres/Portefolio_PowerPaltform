 Mobile Canvas App

In this academic project the goal was to develop a canvas app for a gym where the user/employee could:
- register himself; 
- change the password;
- upload the photos relative to the "local" where they would do their tasks, after selecting the "local" and each item from "listagem";
- the user/employee to send the records from their tasks need do complete each of the tasks from the "local" they selected.
